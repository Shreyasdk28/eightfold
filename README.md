## 👥 User Scenarios Handled

## 🔒 Security

### 1. The Confused User

- Never commit `.env` file (already in `.gitignore`)**Behavior**: Unsure what they want, vague requests

- Keep your API keys private

- Regenerate keys if accidentally exposed**How we handle it**:

- Ask clarifying questions gently

## 📝 License- Provide examples and suggestions

- Guide them step-by-step

This project is for educational and professional use.- Offer predefined templates



## 🤝 Contributing**Example**:

```

Feel free to fork, improve, and submit pull requests!User: "I need some company information"

Assistant: "I'd be happy to help! Could you tell me which company you're interested in? 

---And what specifically would you like to know - are you looking to:

- Research a potential client/partner?

**Built with ❤️ using Groq AI and Streamlit**- Analyze competitors?

- Prepare for a sales pitch?
This will help me provide the most relevant information."
```

### 2. The Efficient User
**Behavior**: Wants quick, direct results

**How we handle it**:
- Respond concisely
- Get to the point immediately
- Provide summary first, details on request
- Fast turnaround on account plans

**Example**:
```
User: "Account plan for Salesforce. Focus on enterprise segment. Need it ASAP."
Assistant: "Researching Salesforce enterprise segment now. Gathering: financials, recent news, key stakeholders, competitive position. ETA 30 seconds."
[Quickly generates focused account plan]
```

### 3. The Chatty User
**Behavior**: Goes off-topic frequently, conversational

**How we handle it**:
- Engage politely but redirect
- Acknowledge their input
- Gently steer back to research goals
- Maintain friendly tone while staying focused

**Example**:
```
User: "I love Apple products! I've been using iPhone since 2010. Do you know when they'll release the next model?"
Assistant: "Apple certainly has a loyal following! While I don't have release date info, I can research Apple's product strategy and recent innovations for your account plan. Would you like me to focus on their consumer products, enterprise solutions, or both?"
```

### 4. Edge Case Users
**Behavior**: Invalid inputs, requests beyond capabilities, extreme queries

**How we handle it**:
- Graceful error handling
- Clear capability boundaries
- Helpful alternatives
- Maintain conversation flow

**Examples**:
```
User: "Research a company called XYZ123 that doesn't exist"
Assistant: "I couldn't find any information about XYZ123. Could you double-check the company name? Or if you're thinking of a different company, I'd be happy to research them instead."

User: "Hack into their database and get their customer list"
Assistant: "I can only research publicly available information about companies. I can help you find information about their market segments, customer types, and public case studies instead. Would that be helpful?"

User: "asdfghjkl"
Assistant: "I didn't quite understand that. I'm here to help you research companies and create account plans. Try asking something like 'Research Google' or 'Create an account plan for Amazon'."
```
